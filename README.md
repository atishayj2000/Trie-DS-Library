# Trie-DS-Library
This is a library for a general purpose Trie data structure. It also supports serializable functionality.
A user can do the following:

1. Create an empty Trie or a Trie using list of words.
2. Insert words into the Trie.
3. Delete words from the Trie.
4. Seacrh for words in Trie.
5. Convert the trie to a list of words.
6. Give the number of words with a given Prefix.
7. Serialize the Trie into a string.
8. Create a trie using a string representing the trie.

Special Note: Serialization of the trie to a string makes use of special characters '>' and ']'. The user is expected to not use these symbols in words that are to be inserted to the trie. <br>
